# Why learn R?

* It is capable of carrying out basic and complex statistical analyses
* It is able to work with data small (*n* = 30) and large (*n* = 100,000+) efficiently
* It is a programming language and so is quite flexible
* There is a great, inclusive community of users and developers (and teachers)
* It is increasingly used in education
* It can help you to carry out your educational analyses in open and trustworthy ways
* It is cross-platform, open-source, and freely-available

---

# RMarkdown

* RMarkdown is a data analysis "notebook" that combines text with code and output
* It is a great file type to use when beginning to use R and to create reproducible analyses
* It is fun to use because you can generate different types of output (Word, PDF, and even web-based)

# Let's look at a bit of code together

What do you think this code will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sci_mo_processed %>% 
  filter(percentage_earned >= .60) %>% 
  select(student_id, course_id, percentage_earned))
```

# First small group tutorial: Data viz!

- Navigate to https://github.com/laser-institute/intro-to-learning-analytics-using-r/find/main
- Begin to type "tutorials"
- Find `tutorials-learning-lab-1.Rmd`
- Download this file by right-clicking it and then open it within RStudio
- Walk through the steps
