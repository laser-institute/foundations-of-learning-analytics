# Outline for this learning lab

1. Setting the stage for the learning labs
2. A quick look at RStudio Cloud
3. A framework for thinking about your work with R

#  1. Setting the stage for the learning labs

You'll be doing three primary things during the learning labs:

- _Running_ R code that we wrote
- _Modifying_ that R code to achieve your goal
- _Writing R code_ from scratch to solve a particular problem

---

#  1. Setting the stage for the learning labs

These learning labs have a few features:

- **Situated** in STEM education contexts
- **Scaffolded** to provide you opportunities to learn about the R code and why you might use or write R code how you are 
- **Allow multiple paths** to completing: in a more _guided_ (with a LASER team member) mode or peer groups
- Are associated with _reach_ **opportunities to do more**, chances for you to apply what you have learned
with your own data (or to your own context)
- Are accompanied by **just-in-time support** from peers and us as you need it

---

# 2. A quick look at RStudio Cloud

Let's take a peak at the Getting Started activty as the context for this:

# 3. A framework for thinking about your work with R

- As STEM education researchers, it is important to us to consider _how_ we make sense of 
using R and doing learning analytics

   - frameworks and mental models are a big part of how we do this "sense-making"
   
- Here, we'll focus on the **foundational skills framework**
  - this framework is for the key technical components of your use of R 
  - this complements the _process_ of the *LASER cycle* 

---

# 3. A framework for thinking about your work with R

- The **foundational skills framework** has four parts

  - *R Studio Projects*: How you organize your analyses that are a part of the same over-arching research project or analysis
  - *Functions*: How you take steps to work with your data; functions have names and arguments: `my_function(the_argument)`
  - *Packages*: What you install and load to extend the functionality of R; packages provide you with new functions
  - *Data and your environment*: Data is the main object on which functions operate; data is loaded into your environment and you often have multiple data frames loaded at once

# In conclusion

Learning R is very hard!

**R you ready for R?**

----

Let's proceed to running, modifying, and running R code in RStudio Cloud!

We'll start with a refresher of the **Getting Started** task, then will proceed to **Learning Analytics Foundations Learning Labs 1 and 2**

Head over to the LASER Learning Lab space to get started: https://rstudio.cloud/projects
